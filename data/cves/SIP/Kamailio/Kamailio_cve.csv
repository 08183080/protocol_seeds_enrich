CVE-2016-2385,N/A,N/A,N/A,2016-04-11,2025-04-12,Heap-based buffer overflow in the encode_msg function in encode_msg.c in the SEAS module in Kamailio (formerly OpenSER and SER) before 4.3.5 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption and process crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a large SIP packet.
CVE-2015-1591,N/A,N/A,N/A,2017-06-27,2025-04-20,The kamailio build in kamailio before 4.2.0-2 process allows local users to gain privileges.
CVE-2013-7426,N/A,N/A,N/A,2017-08-29,2025-04-20,Insecure Temporary file vulnerability in /tmp/kamailio_fifo in kamailio 4.0.1.
CVE-2015-1590,N/A,N/A,N/A,2017-09-07,2025-04-20,The kamcmd administrative utility and default configuration in kamailio before 4.3.0 use /tmp/kamailio_ctl.
CVE-2018-8828,N/A,N/A,N/A,2018-03-20,2024-11-21,"A Buffer Overflow issue was discovered in Kamailio before 4.4.7, 5.0.x before 5.0.6, and 5.1.x before 5.1.2. A specially crafted REGISTER message with a malformed branch or From tag triggers an off-by-one heap-based buffer overflow in the tmx_check_pretran function in modules/tmx/tmx_pretran.c."
CVE-2018-14767,N/A,N/A,N/A,2018-07-31,2024-11-21,"In Kamailio before 5.0.7 and 5.1.x before 5.1.4, a crafted SIP message with a double ""To"" header and an empty ""To"" tag causes a segmentation fault and crash. The reason is missing input validation in the ""build_res_buf_from_sip_req"" core function. This could result in denial of service and potentially the execution of arbitrary code."
CVE-2018-16657,N/A,N/A,N/A,2018-09-07,2024-11-21,"In Kamailio before 5.0.7 and 5.1.x before 5.1.4, a crafted SIP message with an invalid Via header causes a segmentation fault and crashes Kamailio. The reason is missing input validation in the crcitt_string_array core function for calculating a CRC hash for To tags. (An additional error is present in the check_via_address core function: this function also misses input validation.) This could result in denial of service and potentially the execution of arbitrary code."
CVE-2020-28361,MEDIUM,5.4,CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N,2020-11-18,2024-11-21,"Kamailio before 5.4.0, as used in Sip Express Router (SER) in Sippy Softswitch 4.5 through 5.2 and other products, allows a bypass of a header-removal protection mechanism via whitespace characters. This occurs in the remove_hf function in the Kamailio textops module. Particular use of remove_hf in Sippy Softswitch may allow skilled attacker having a valid credential in the system to disrupt internal call start/duration accounting mechanisms leading potentially to a loss of revenue."
CVE-2020-27507,CRITICAL,9.8,CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H,2023-03-15,2025-02-27,"The Kamailio SIP before 5.5.0 server mishandles INVITE requests with duplicated fields and overlength tag, leading to a buffer overflow that crashes the server or possibly have unspecified other impact."
CVE-2025-12204,MEDIUM,5.3,CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L,2025-10-27,2025-11-04,A security vulnerability has been detected in Kamailio 5.5. Impacted is the function rve_destroy of the file src/core/rvalue.c of the component Configuration File Handler. The manipulation leads to heap-based buffer overflow. The attack must be carried out locally. The exploit has been disclosed publicly and may be used. There is ongoing doubt regarding the real existence of this vulnerability. This attack requires manipulating config files which might not be a realistic scenario in many cases. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.
CVE-2025-12205,MEDIUM,5.3,CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L,2025-10-27,2025-11-04,A vulnerability was detected in Kamailio 5.5. The affected element is the function sr_push_yy_state of the file src/core/cfg.lex of the component Configuration File Handler. The manipulation results in use after free. The attack must be initiated from a local position. The exploit is now public and may be used. The real existence of this vulnerability is still doubted at the moment. This attack requires manipulating config files which might not be a realistic scenario in many cases. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.
CVE-2025-12206,LOW,3.3,CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L,2025-10-27,2025-11-04,A flaw has been found in Kamailio 5.5. The impacted element is the function rve_is_constant of the file src/core/rvalue.c. This manipulation causes null pointer dereference. The attack needs to be launched locally. The exploit has been published and may be used. It is still unclear if this vulnerability genuinely exists. This attack requires manipulating config files which might not be a realistic scenario in many cases. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.
CVE-2025-12207,LOW,3.3,CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L,2025-10-27,2025-11-04,A vulnerability has been found in Kamailio 5.5. This affects the function yyerror_at of the file src/core/cfg.y of the component Grammar Rule Handler. Such manipulation leads to null pointer dereference. The attack needs to be performed locally. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The actual existence of this vulnerability is currently in question. This attack requires manipulating config files which might not be a realistic scenario in many cases. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.
