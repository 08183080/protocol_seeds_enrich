CVE-2025-44651,HIGH,7.5,CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H,2025-07-21,2025-08-07,"In TRENDnet TPL-430AP FW1.0, the USERLIMIT_GLOBAL option is set to 0 in the bftpd-related configuration file. This can cause DoS attacks when unlimited users are connected."
CVE-2025-44652,HIGH,7.5,CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H,2025-07-21,2025-08-07,"In Netgear RAX30 V1.0.10.94_3, the USERLIMIT_GLOBAL option is set to 0 in multiple bftpd-related configuration files. This can cause DoS attacks when unlimited users are connected."
CVE-2025-11947,MEDIUM,4.5,CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L,2025-10-19,2025-10-21,A weakness has been identified in bftpd up to 6.2. Impacted is the function expand_groups of the file options.c of the component Configuration File Handler. Executing manipulation can lead to heap-based buffer overflow. It is possible to launch the attack on the local host. Attacks of this nature are highly complex. The exploitability is considered difficult. The exploit has been made available to the public and could be exploited. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.
