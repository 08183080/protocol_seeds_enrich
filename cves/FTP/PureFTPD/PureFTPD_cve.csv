CVE-2011-0988,N/A,N/A,N/A,2011-04-18,2025-04-11,"pure-ftpd 1.0.22, as used in SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 10 SP3 and SP4, and Enterprise Desktop 10 SP3 and SP4, when running OES Netware extensions, creates a world-writeable directory, which allows local users to overwrite arbitrary files and gain privileges via unspecified vectors."
CVE-2011-1575,N/A,N/A,N/A,2011-05-23,2025-04-11,"The STARTTLS implementation in ftp_parser.c in Pure-FTPd before 1.0.30 does not properly restrict I/O buffering, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to insert commands into encrypted FTP sessions by sending a cleartext command that is processed after TLS is in place, related to a ""plaintext command injection"" attack, a similar issue to CVE-2011-0411."
CVE-2011-0418,N/A,N/A,N/A,2011-05-24,2025-04-11,"The glob implementation in Pure-FTPd before 1.0.32, and in libc in NetBSD 5.1, does not properly expand expressions containing curly brackets, which allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via a crafted FTP STAT command."
CVE-2011-3171,N/A,N/A,N/A,2011-11-04,2025-04-11,"Directory traversal vulnerability in pure-FTPd 1.0.22 and possibly other versions, when running on SUSE Linux Enterprise Server and possibly other operating systems, when the Netware OES remote server feature is enabled, allows local users to overwrite arbitrary files via unknown vectors."
CVE-2017-12170,N/A,N/A,N/A,2017-09-21,2025-04-20,Downstream version 1.0.46-1 of pure-ftpd as shipped in Fedora was vulnerable to packaging error due to which the original configuration was ignored after update and service started running with default configuration. This has security implications because of overriding security-related configuration. This issue doesn't affect upstream version of pure-ftpd.
CVE-2019-20176,HIGH,7.5,CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H,2019-12-31,2024-11-21,"In Pure-FTPd 1.0.49, a stack exhaustion issue was discovered in the listdir function in ls.c."
CVE-2020-9365,HIGH,7.5,CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N,2020-02-24,2024-11-21,An issue was discovered in Pure-FTPd 1.0.49. An out-of-bounds (OOB) read has been detected in the pure_strcmp function in utils.c.
CVE-2020-9274,HIGH,7.5,CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N,2020-02-26,2024-11-21,"An issue was discovered in Pure-FTPd 1.0.49. An uninitialized pointer vulnerability has been detected in the diraliases linked list. When the *lookup_alias(const char alias) or print_aliases(void) function is called, they fail to correctly detect the end of the linked list and try to access a non-existent list member. This is related to init_aliases in diraliases.c."
CVE-2020-35359,HIGH,7.5,CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H,2020-12-26,2024-11-21,Pure-FTPd 1.0.48 allows remote attackers to prevent legitimate server use by making enough connections to exceed the connection limit.
CVE-2021-40524,HIGH,7.5,CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H,2021-09-05,2025-11-04,"In Pure-FTPd before 1.0.50, an incorrect max_filesize quota mechanism in the server allows attackers to upload files of unbounded size, which may lead to denial of service or a server hang. This occurs because a certain greater-than-zero test does not anticipate an initial -1 value. (Versions 1.0.23 through 1.0.49 are affected.)"
CVE-2024-48208,HIGH,8.6,CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:H,2024-10-24,2025-09-04,pure-ftpd before 1.0.52 is vulnerable to Buffer Overflow. There is an out of bounds read in the domlsd() function of the ls.c file.
